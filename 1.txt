Little girl, little girl,
Where have you been?
I've been to see grandmother
Over the green.

What did she give you?
Milk in a can.
What did you say for it?
Thank you, Grandam.

Dame Trot and her cat
Sat down for a chat;
The Dame sat on this side
And puss sat on that.

Puss, says the Dam,
Can you catch a rat,
Or a mouse in the dark?
Purr, says the cat.
